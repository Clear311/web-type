<div class="what">
    <p>This website is a knock-off version of google. It was inspired by the frequent distractions in our daily life with modern technologies and social media. Most of us probably have this sort of experience: we wanted to search something up but then we get distracted by some other information on the search engine/ notifications appearing on the page. And then we fall into the rabbit hole of more and more information because one piece of info leads to another. We are no longer in control of our thoughts but to accept what is being fed to us. Our actions are directed by the tools we use. In the end, we forgot what we wanted to do originally and a huge amount of time was wasted on the platform. Curiosity and temporary pleasure makes it hard for us to resist the distractions. Thus, I created this site to make the distraction to an extreme with the intention to dramatize the experience and to raise awareness. The "we guess" section is based on the random pictures floating, mimicking how the platforms manipulate us into thinking about certain things. Notifications of different platforms pop up frequently as well. Even if the user wants to search up something, their original thoughts will be blurred. We want to stop, but we can't stop but keep on receiving more and more distractions. <br><br> Designed by: Clear Shen @RISD<br> Web Type 2021</p>
